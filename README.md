# JerseySimpleProject
This was a quick and dirty project that i created while evaluating Jersey Versus Spring for REST webservices.
This rest service has following features..

1)	A Simple GET ALL request example  
2)	GET specific request example
3)	POST example
4)	Dependency Injection(HK2 versus Spring)
5)	Bean Validation 
6)	Filter- A Response Filter that adds X-Powered-By header 
7) Test class that explains dependecy injection
